    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>For the Dough:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast.
                    Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups of flour and salt.
                    Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7
                    minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour if necessary.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth,
                    and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <strong><li>Make the Sauce:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
                    Simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <strong><li>Preheat Oven</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <strong><li>Assemble the Pizza:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper.
                    If not, place it on a greased or cornmeal-dusted pizza pan.</li>
                <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese and add your favorite toppings.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <strong><li>Bake:</li></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the parchment paper with the pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven.
                If using a pan, place the pan directly in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>        
    </ol>
