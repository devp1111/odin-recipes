    <p>Gelato is a traditional Italian frozen dessert that is often compared to ice cream. 
    While both are frozen desserts, there are some key differences in ingredients, texture, and 
    preparation methods. Gelato typically has a lower butterfat content, less air churned into it, 
    and is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, resulting in a denser and creamier texture.</p>

                <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <strong><li>For the Base:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the whole milk and heavy cream. 
                            Heat the mixture over medium heat until it starts to steam, but do not bring it to a boil.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <strong><li>Mix the Sugar and Vanilla:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, vanilla extract, 
                            and a pinch of salt until well combined.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <strong><li>Combine and Cook:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gradually add the sugar and vanilla mixture to the saucepan with the milk and cream,
                            stirring constantly.</li>
                        <li>Continue cooking the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens
                            slightly and reaches a temperature of about 170°F (77°C). Do not let it boil.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <strong><li>Chill the Mixture:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool to room temperature. Once cooled,
                            cover the mixture and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <strong><li>Churn and Freeze:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After the mixture has chilled, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn according
                            to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                        <li>Once churned, transfer the gelato to a lidded container and freeze for a few hours
                            until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <strong><li>Serve:</li></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scoop and serve the gelato in bowls or cones. You can garnish with fresh fruit, nuts,
                            or a drizzle of chocolate sauce if desired.</li>
